READ ME:

Before launching this mod, make sure you have an Elden Ring Offline Launcher, if you do not, the link is below:
https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/90

This will give you an Offline launcher file that you must place within:
Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > ELDEN RING > Game 
(I like to set up a shortcut to it so I don't have to keep going into the files)

THIS WILL MAKE IT SAFE TO RUN THE CHEAT TABLE, DO NOT RUN THE CHEAT TABLE WITH ANTICHEAT / ONLINE MODE ON

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, make sure you have cheat engine, I know the website looks sketchy but this is the official site if you do not have it already:
https://www.cheatengine.org/

THIS CHEAT TABLE WAS MADE ON CHEAT ENGINE VERSION 7.5, I am not sure how it works on other versions because I wasn't able to download 7.6 for whatever reason.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyways, once you download it, connect it to your game (with the top left icon) and enable both the staminaBlocker & flaskRegen & it should be working.

Enjoy!

KNOWN BUGS:
 - When FP is depleted, HP Flasks will not "heal" stamina
 - Upon suffering the bleed status effect, this "heals" stamina
 - (Totally a feature) The Flask of Wonderous Physick "heals" stamina
